# This repository is about me tring to understand react. 
## So its time I get my hands dirty with it.   Will be overhauling some old code and hopefully React makes thngs easier. I'll be the judge.  


Main Site functionaly will consist of the following functionalities.  

1). A resume page showcasing my fav projects. 
2) I run a lot, so a personal blog about my running activities and and fitness goals. 


3). Might consider hosting this on AWS, not sure which of their serivces will be best.  Have a lot of Documentation to read.  

I hope it is not too much of a heach ache.
